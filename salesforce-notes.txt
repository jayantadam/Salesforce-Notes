=================================================================INTERVIEW QUESTIONS=========================================================================================================================
1. Profiles vs. Permission Sets (Common Interview Question)

Feature         Profile                     Permission Set
Purpose         Base permissions            Additional permissions
Assignedto      1 peruser                   Multiple per user
Flexibility     Less flexibleVery           flexible

2. Can we delete user in salesforce org
either you can deactive the user else freeze the user

👉 Freeze = temporary login block
👉 Deactivate = permanent block + frees license

                          Deactivate User                                          Freeze user
Login -                User cannot log in.                                  User cannot log in anymore.                        
Active                 User is marked Inactive                              Their user record stays Active = true                                         
Scheduled jobs         Scheduled jobs fails                                 Scheduled jobs runs
License                The user’s license becomes available for reuse       The user’s license becomes unavailable for reuse         
Record ownership       Stays the same                                       Not Stays the same     

3. PROFILE vs ROLE — Simple Definition

Profile = What a user can do (permissions)
Role = What data a user can see (data visibility)

CRUD                         A Profile defines permissions like Create, Read, Edit, Delete,          While a Role defines data visibility.
mandatory                    A Profile is mandatory;                                                 a Role is optional.
How many per user?           A user can have only one Profile,                                       but may have zero or one Role.
Controls Field‑Level Security?  Yes                                                                      No
Controls Record Access?         No                                                                      Yes
Part of Sharing Model?          No                                                                      Yes
Hierarchy?                      No hierarchy                                                         Has hierarchy (manager → subordinate data visibility)
Login Restrictions              Profiles affect login restrictions and app/tab access;                      Roles do not.
Sharing Model                   Roles participate in record-sharing hierarchy;                              Profiles do not.

  uncheck below permission in System Permissions before setting the field-level permission if it is already selected in your profile
Home -> profile -> your custom profile -> System Permissions -> Edit Read Only Fields -> uncheck   

If user is not able to see the developer console how can he get it (video 8 - 1.57min)
    Home -> profile -> your custom profile -> System Permissions -> View All Data -> checkbox should checked -> you will get developer console

Inside developer console if user wants to remove apex control in developer console  (video 8 - 1.59min)
   Home -> profile -> your custom profile -> System Permissions -> Author Apex -> checkbox should not checked -> you will not get apex control in developer console

Data types

Text: Stores alphanumeric characters up to a specified length.
Number: Stores numeric values, can include decimals.
Currency: Stores monetary values with currency symbol.
Date: Stores calendar dates without time.
Date/Time: Stores both date and time values.
Checkbox: Boolean field for true/false values.
Picklist(dropdown):
  Stores a single value chosen from a predefined list of options. Useful for enforcing data consistency (e.g., Status = Open, Closed, Pending).
  Supports restricted (only predefined values allowed) and unrestricted (users can add new values) modes. Can be dependent on another picklist for dynamic filtering.
Multi-Select Picklist:
  Allows users to select multiple values from a predefined list. Useful for scenarios where more than one option applies (e.g., Skills = Java, Salesforce, Angular).
  Values are stored as a semicolon-separated string. Cannot be used in standard reports for filtering easily and has limitations in formulas and automation 
  compared to single picklists.
Master-Detail Relationship:
  Creates a tight parent-child relationship between two objects where the child (detail) record is dependent on the parent (master) record. The parent controls record
  ownership, sharing, and deletion (if the master is deleted, the detail is also deleted). It supports roll-up summary fields on the master object to aggregate data 
  from child recordsFormula: Calculates values dynamically based on other fields.

Email: Stores email addresses.
Phone: Stores phone numbers.
URL: Stores website addresses.
Lookup Relationship: Links to another record in Salesforce.
Auto Number: Generates a unique sequential number automatically.
Long Text Area: Stores large blocks of text (up to 131,072 characters).
Rich Text Area: Stores formatted text with images and links.
==========================================================================================================================================================================================
Controlling field can be picklist and checkbox (holds Boolean values) 
Dependent field can be only picklist
==========================================================================================================================================================================================
Master-Detail Relationship => If we want to create for already present records

option 1 - We have to delete existing records
option 2 - We have to add first lookup fields then add value to the field then change to lookup to master detail field 
==========================================================================================================================================================================================
✅ 1. Lookup Relationship
  Purpose: Links two objects loosely (child can exist without parent).
  Key Features:
  Optional relationship; child record can have a null parent.
  No roll-up summary fields.
  Ownership and sharing are independent.
Use Case: When you need a flexible link between objects (e.g., Contact linked to Account but can exist independently).
✅ 2. Picklist
  Purpose: Field type that stores a single value from a predefined list.
  Key Features:
  Used for categorization (e.g., Status = Open, Closed).
  No object relationship; purely a field-level control.
  Supports dependent picklists for dynamic filtering.
Use Case: When you need controlled values for a field, not linking objects.
✅ 3. Master-Detail Relationship
  Purpose: Creates a strong (tightly)  parent-child relationship between two objects. we can add to the record once added cant update it that field
  Key Features:
  Child record cannot exist without parent.
  Parent controls ownership, sharing, and deletion.
  Supports roll-up summary fields on the master object.

==========================================================================================================================================================================================
Lighting mode 
  We can search object with label only

In classic mode
  we can search object with label and API name
==========================================================================================================================================================================================
✅ 1. Lookup Relationship
  Description: A loose association between two objects.
  Key Points:
  Child can exist without a parent.
  No cascade delete.
  No roll-up summary fields.
  Example: Contact linked to Account (but can exist independently).

✅ 2. Master-Detail Relationship
  Description: A strong parent-child relationship.
  Key Points:
  Child record cannot exist without parent.
  Parent controls ownership, sharing, and deletion.
  Supports roll-up summary fields on the master.
  Example: Invoice Line Items tied to Invoice.

✅ 3. Many-to-Many Relationship
  Description: Achieved using a junction object with two master-detail relationships. we can reduce duplicate records with help of this
  Key Points:
  Allows linking multiple records from two objects.
  Example: Students and Courses.

Delete Behavior
junction records can delete from both the parents Student and Events
    Because the junction object uses Master-Detail relationships, its records are dependent on both parents.
    If either parent record is deleted, all related junction records are automatically deleted (cascade delete).
    The other parent remains intact, but loses the link because the junction record is gone.

Example :- lets assume we have 2 parents Student and Event object and junction object (Student event info)

      1. If John (Student) is deleted:
        All his related junction records (registrations) are deleted.
        Events remain intact.

      2. If Salesforce Workshop (Event) is deleted:
         All junction records for that event are deleted.
         Students remain intact.

Security control :- can have first have first parernt object (in this cases student object bacuase we have event lookup)

✅ 4. Hierarchical Relationship
  Description: Special lookup relationship available only on User object.
  Key Points:
  Used to create hierarchy among users (e.g., Manager → Employee).

✅ 5. External Lookup & Indirect Lookup
  Description: Used to link external objects (from external systems) to Salesforce objects.
  Key Points:
  External Lookup links external object to standard/custom object.
  Indirect Lookup links external object to Salesforce object using an external ID.

==========================================================================================================================================================================================
why if Account record deleted then contact and oppportunites deleting?

The relationship between Account → Opportunity (and some other standard objects) appears as a Lookup relationship in the schema.

Salesforce has something called implicit cascade delete for certain standard objects(contact).

For Account → Contact, the platform automatically cascades the delete:

    From the UI, it shows a Lookup relationship for Contact, but in the backend, it works like a Master-Detail relationship because there is
    a standard Boolean field called CascadeDelete, and its default value is true.

For Account → Opportunity, Lookups don’t auto-delete:
        Normally, deleting an Account does NOT auto-delete Opportunities
        But they can be deleted if:
        You choose “Delete Account and Related Records”
        A Flow or Apex Trigger is configured
        Cascade Delete is enabled in Account Settings

==========================================================================================================================================================================================
What is a Roll-Up Summary Field? (I have created in account object) 
A special field type on the master (parent) object that aggregates data from its detail (child) records and it show read only mode.

On Account, you can create a Roll-Up Summary field to:
Count the number of Contacts.
Sum the Opportunity Amounts.
Find the latest Opportunity Close Date.

==========================================================================================================================================================================================
How many master detail relationship can create in one object ==> 2 
How many lookup relationship can create in one object ==> No fixed limit*
Combined (lookup + master-detail)40 (default), up to 50 (max)
==========================================================================================================================================================================================

Schema Builder (Setup=>Home=>Quick find => Schema Builder) - Salesforce Schema Builder is a visual, drag-and-drop tool that lets 
administrators and developers design, visualize,and manage the data model (objects, fields, and relationships) in their Salesforce org through a graphical interface,
making it easier to understand complex data structures and build new custom elements without writing code.

abs ==> you can get new tab with objects


lookup relationship - create a relationship to connects two objects loosely, allowing a child record to point to a parent record
 (like an Account to a Contact, or a custom object to a User) for data sharing, but the child can exist independently.
 it's defined on the child object by creating a new "Lookup Relationship" field, linking to the parent object, enabling easy data association without strict dependency or automatic deletion (unlike Master-Detail). 

Key Characteristics:
Loose Coupling: Child records aren't deleted if the parent is deleted (unless configured otherwise).
Optional: The lookup field on the child record doesn't have to be filled, allowing the child to exist without a parent.
One-to-Many: Typically links many child records to one parent record (e.g., many Contacts to one Account).
No Roll-Up Summaries: Cannot use Roll-Up Summary fields, which are a Master-Detail feature.
Creation: Created on the child object by selecting "Lookup Relationship" as the field type and choosing the parent object.

What is profile in salesforce - video 8 - 9.40 seconds

          prfile view change video 8 - 1.25 min 
          HOME -> User Management Settings -> Enhanced Profile User Interface -> enable it 
          using above thing we can do profile change easily

profile is an object 
standard prfile can't delete

we can create profile from taking clone from standard profile
one user can have only one profile

In Salesforce, a Profile is a fundamental security and access control component. It defines what a user can do in the Salesforce org.
1. Object Permissions
Determines what actions a user can perform on objects: Create,Read,Edit,Delete,View All,Modify All
Example: A Sales Rep may edit Opportunities but not modify Users.

2. Field-Level Security (FLS)
Specifies which fields a user can: See,Edit
Example: Salary field may be hidden for non-HR users.

3. User Permissions
Allows specific capabilities like: API Enabled,View Setup,Run Reports,Manage Dashboards

4. Tab Settings
Controls whether a tab is: Default On, Default Off,Hidden

5. Apps & Page Layout Assignments
Decides which: Apps users can access, Page layouts they see

6. Login Controls
Manages:Login IP ranges,Login hours
==========================================================================================================================================================================================
Login Access Policies video 8 - 12.25 seconds 
Login Access Policies in Salesforce are organization‑wide settings that control who can log in as whom and under what circumstances.
They allow users to grant temporary access to Salesforce Support or internal administrators for troubleshooting.

==========================================================================================================================================================================================
Session settings video 8 - 21.06 seconds 
Force relogin after Login-As-User - it should uncheck by default so that when you do login it will not logout from admin
session timeout - we selct hours
==========================================================================================================================================================================================

HOME -> User Management Settings -> Enhanced Profile User Interface -> enable it 
==========================================================================================================================================================================================
Field‑Level permissions (video 8 - 1.48min)
uncheck below permission in System Permissions before setting the field-level permission if it is already selected in your profile
Home -> profile -> your custom profile -> System Permissions -> Edit Read Only Fields -> uncheck
==========================================================================================================================================================================================
What Are Permission Sets in Salesforce?
    A Permission Set is a collection of settings and permissions that give users additional access on top of their Profile.
    Think of it as:
    👉 Profile = Base access
    👉 Permission Set = Extra access
    You use Permission Sets when you want to give someone more permissions without changing their profile.
How Many Permission Sets Can a User Have?
        A user can have:
        👉 One Profile
        👉 Many Permission Sets (no strict limit)

  🏆 What Permission Sets Can Control
         ✔Object permissions,(Create, Read, Edit, Delete),✔ Field‑level security,(Make fields visible/editable),✔ App permissions
      (Access to apps, tabs, features),✔ System permissions,(API Enabled, View Setup, Modify All Data, etc.),✔ User permissions,(Manage Reports, Run Flow, etc.)
        ✔Record types,✔ Apex class access,✔ VF page access,✔ Connected apps

Permission Sets vs Permission Set Groups
    Permission Set Groups allow you to combine multiple permission sets into one bundle.
You use them when:
    You have many permission sets
    You want to assign them together efficiently
    You want to remove overlapping permissions using Muting
