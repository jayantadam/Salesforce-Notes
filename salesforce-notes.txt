=================================================================INTERVIEW QUESTIONS=========================================================================================================================
1. Profiles vs. Permission Sets (Common Interview Question)

Feature         Profile                     Permission Set
Purpose         Base permissions            Additional permissions
Assignedto      1 peruser                   Multiple per user
Flexibility     Less flexibleVery           flexible

2. Can we delete user in salesforce org
either you can deactive the user else freeze the user

👉 Freeze = temporary login block
👉 Deactivate = permanent block + frees license

                          Deactivate User                                          Freeze user
Login -                User cannot log in.                                  User cannot log in anymore.                        
Active                 User is marked Inactive                              Their user record stays Active = true                                         
Scheduled jobs         Scheduled jobs fails                                 Scheduled jobs runs
License                The user’s license becomes available for reuse       The user’s license becomes unavailable for reuse         
Record ownership       Stays the same                                       Not Stays the same     

3. PROFILE vs ROLE — Simple Definition

Profile = What a user can do (permissions)
Role = What data a user can see (data visibility)

CRUD                         A Profile defines permissions like Create, Read, Edit, Delete,          While a Role defines data visibility.
mandatory                    A Profile is mandatory;                                                 a Role is optional.
How many per user?           A user can have only one Profile,                                       but may have zero or one Role.
Controls Field‑Level Security?  Yes                                                                      No
Controls Record Access?         No                                                                      Yes
Part of Sharing Model?          No                                                                      Yes
Hierarchy?                      No hierarchy                                                         Has hierarchy (manager → subordinate data visibility)
Login Restrictions              Profiles affect login restrictions and app/tab access;                      Roles do not.
Sharing Model                   Roles participate in record-sharing hierarchy;                              Profiles do not.

Salesforce Security Model (video 9 - 55.54 seconds)
            Salesforce uses a layered security model to control data access at different levels:

            *   Organization-Wide Defaults (OWD) (sharing setting in setup): Baseline access (Private, Public Read Only, Public Read/Write).
            *   Role Hierarchy :  Users higher in hierarchy inherit access to subordinates’ records.
            *   Sharing Rules:  (if object has private OWD then you get sharing rules, setup => sharing setting => object name Sharing Rules) 
                                Open up access based on criteria or ownership.
            *   Manual Sharing: Record owner shares specific records.
            *   Teams: Account, Opportunity, Case teams for collaborative access.
            *   Apex Managed Sharing: Programmatic sharing for custom logic.

            1.  Object-Level Security (CRUD)  
                Controls access to entire objects like Account, Contact, Opportunity.  
                Managed through Profiles and Permission Sets.  
                Example: A user may have Read access to Accounts but no Delete access.

            2.  Field-Level Security (FLS)  
                Controls visibility and editability of individual fields within an object.  
                Managed through Profiles and Permission Sets.  
                Example: A user can view Account Name but not Revenue field.

            3.  Record-Level Security  
                Controls which records within an object a user can access.  
                Components:


            Additional Security Features  
            Login & Session Security: IP restrictions, login hours, MFA.  
            Data Encryption: Shield Platform Encryption for sensitive data.  
            Auditing & Monitoring: Field history tracking, Setup Audit Trail, Event Monitoring.  
            Record Types & Page Layouts: Control UI and data entry experience.

            Hierarchy of Access  
            Profiles and Permission Sets → Field-Level Security → OWD → Role Hierarchy → Sharing Rules → Manual Sharing.

            Example  
            OWD for Account = Private → Users see only their own Accounts.  
            Role Hierarchy → Sales Manager sees team’s Accounts.  
            Sharing Rule → Share Accounts in “Enterprise” segment with Marketing.  
            Field-Level Security → Hide Revenue field from Marketing users.

can we assign sharing rule the user (video 9 - 01.00 min)
    No, you cannot assign a Sharing Rule directly to an individual user in Salesforce
      Sharing Rules in Salesforce are designed to open up access for groups of users, not for individual users.
      They work based on:Roles,Roles and Subordinates,Public Groups,Territories,Queues,
     
     
Types of sharing (video 9 - 01.01 min)
  1. owner base sharing 2. criteria base sharing

Public Groups in Salesforce (video 9 - 01.01 min)
  A Public Group is a collection of users, roles, and other groups that can be used to simplify sharing and access management. 
  instead of creating multiple sharing rules for individual users, you can create a Public Group and use it in sharing rules, folder access, and other features

Is permissoin set override the profile permissions
        No, Permission Sets do NOT override Profiles in Salesforce.
      Here’s the rule:
      Profiles set the baseline permissions for a user (object-level, field-level, app-level).
      Permission Sets can add extra permissions on top of what the Profile provides.
      Permission Sets cannot remove or reduce permissions granted by a Profile.

==========================================================================================================================================================================================


Data types

Text: Stores alphanumeric characters up to a specified length.
Number: Stores numeric values, can include decimals.
Currency: Stores monetary values with currency symbol.
Date: Stores calendar dates without time.
Date/Time: Stores both date and time values.
Checkbox: Boolean field for true/false values.
Picklist(dropdown):
  Stores a single value chosen from a predefined list of options. Useful for enforcing data consistency (e.g., Status = Open, Closed, Pending).
  Supports restricted (only predefined values allowed) and unrestricted (users can add new values) modes. Can be dependent on another picklist for dynamic filtering.
Multi-Select Picklist:
  Allows users to select multiple values from a predefined list. Useful for scenarios where more than one option applies (e.g., Skills = Java, Salesforce, Angular).
  Values are stored as a semicolon-separated string. Cannot be used in standard reports for filtering easily and has limitations in formulas and automation 
  compared to single picklists.
Master-Detail Relationship:
  Creates a tight parent-child relationship between two objects where the child (detail) record is dependent on the parent (master) record. The parent controls record
  ownership, sharing, and deletion (if the master is deleted, the detail is also deleted). It supports roll-up summary fields on the master object to aggregate data 
  from child recordsFormula: Calculates values dynamically based on other fields.

Email: Stores email addresses.
Phone: Stores phone numbers.
URL: Stores website addresses.
Lookup Relationship: Links to another record in Salesforce.
Auto Number: Generates a unique sequential number automatically.
Long Text Area: Stores large blocks of text (up to 131,072 characters).
Rich Text Area: Stores formatted text with images and links.
==========================================================================================================================================================================================
Controlling field can be picklist and checkbox (holds Boolean values) 
Dependent field can be only picklist
==========================================================================================================================================================================================
Master-Detail Relationship => If we want to create for already present records

option 1 - We have to delete existing records
option 2 - We have to add first lookup fields then add value to the field then change to lookup to master detail field 
==========================================================================================================================================================================================
✅ 1. Lookup Relationship
  Purpose: Links two objects loosely (child can exist without parent).
  Key Features:
  Optional relationship; child record can have a null parent.
  No roll-up summary fields.
  Ownership and sharing are independent.
Use Case: When you need a flexible link between objects (e.g., Contact linked to Account but can exist independently).
✅ 2. Picklist
  Purpose: Field type that stores a single value from a predefined list.
  Key Features:
  Used for categorization (e.g., Status = Open, Closed).
  No object relationship; purely a field-level control.
  Supports dependent picklists for dynamic filtering.
Use Case: When you need controlled values for a field, not linking objects.
✅ 3. Master-Detail Relationship
  Purpose: Creates a strong (tightly)  parent-child relationship between two objects. we can add to the record once added cant update it that field
  Key Features:
  Child record cannot exist without parent.
  Parent controls ownership, sharing, and deletion.
  Supports roll-up summary fields on the master object.

==========================================================================================================================================================================================
Lighting mode 
  We can search object with label only

In classic mode
  we can search object with label and API name
==========================================================================================================================================================================================
✅ 1. Lookup Relationship
  Description: A loose association between two objects.
  Key Points:
  Child can exist without a parent.
  No cascade delete.
  No roll-up summary fields.
  Example: Contact linked to Account (but can exist independently).

✅ 2. Master-Detail Relationship
  Description: A strong parent-child relationship.
  Key Points:
  Child record cannot exist without parent.
  Parent controls ownership, sharing, and deletion.
  Supports roll-up summary fields on the master.
  Example: Invoice Line Items tied to Invoice.

✅ 3. Many-to-Many Relationship
  Description: Achieved using a junction object with two master-detail relationships. we can reduce duplicate records with help of this
  Key Points:
  Allows linking multiple records from two objects.
  Example: Students and Courses.

Delete Behavior
junction records can delete from both the parents Student and Events
    Because the junction object uses Master-Detail relationships, its records are dependent on both parents.
    If either parent record is deleted, all related junction records are automatically deleted (cascade delete).
    The other parent remains intact, but loses the link because the junction record is gone.

Example :- lets assume we have 2 parents Student and Event object and junction object (Student event info)

      1. If John (Student) is deleted:
        All his related junction records (registrations) are deleted.
        Events remain intact.

      2. If Salesforce Workshop (Event) is deleted:
         All junction records for that event are deleted.
         Students remain intact.

Security control :- can have first have first parernt object (in this cases student object bacuase we have event lookup)

✅ 4. Hierarchical Relationship
  Description: Special lookup relationship available only on User object.
  Key Points:
  Used to create hierarchy among users (e.g., Manager → Employee).

✅ 5. External Lookup & Indirect Lookup
  Description: Used to link external objects (from external systems) to Salesforce objects.
  Key Points:
  External Lookup links external object to standard/custom object.
  Indirect Lookup links external object to Salesforce object using an external ID.

==========================================================================================================================================================================================
why if Account record deleted then contact and oppportunites deleting?

The relationship between Account → Opportunity (and some other standard objects) appears as a Lookup relationship in the schema.

Salesforce has something called implicit cascade delete for certain standard objects(contact).

For Account → Contact, the platform automatically cascades the delete:

    From the UI, it shows a Lookup relationship for Contact, but in the backend, it works like a Master-Detail relationship because there is
    a standard Boolean field called CascadeDelete, and its default value is true.

For Account → Opportunity, Lookups don’t auto-delete:
        Normally, deleting an Account does NOT auto-delete Opportunities
        But they can be deleted if:
        You choose “Delete Account and Related Records”
        A Flow or Apex Trigger is configured
        Cascade Delete is enabled in Account Settings

==========================================================================================================================================================================================
What is a Roll-Up Summary Field? (I have created in account object) 
A special field type on the master (parent) object that aggregates data from its detail (child) records and it show read only mode.

On Account, you can create a Roll-Up Summary field to:
Count the number of Contacts.
Sum the Opportunity Amounts.
Find the latest Opportunity Close Date.

==========================================================================================================================================================================================
How many master detail relationship can create in one object ==> 2 
How many lookup relationship can create in one object ==> No fixed limit
Combined (lookup + master-detail)40 (default), up to 50 (max)
==========================================================================================================================================================================================

abs ==> you can get new tab with objects


lookup relationship - create a relationship to connects two objects loosely, allowing a child record to point to a parent record
 (like an Account to a Contact, or a custom object to a User) for data sharing, but the child can exist independently.
 it's defined on the child object by creating a new "Lookup Relationship" field, linking to the parent object, enabling easy data association without strict dependency or automatic deletion (unlike Master-Detail). 

Key Characteristics:
Loose Coupling: Child records aren't deleted if the parent is deleted (unless configured otherwise).
Optional: The lookup field on the child record doesn't have to be filled, allowing the child to exist without a parent.
One-to-Many: Typically links many child records to one parent record (e.g., many Contacts to one Account).
No Roll-Up Summaries: Cannot use Roll-Up Summary fields, which are a Master-Detail feature.
Creation: Created on the child object by selecting "Lookup Relationship" as the field type and choosing the parent object.

What is profile in salesforce - video 8 - 9.40 seconds

          prfile view change video 8 - 1.25 min 
          HOME -> User Management Settings -> Enhanced Profile User Interface -> enable it 
          using above thing we can do profile change easily

profile is an object 
standard prfile can't delete

we can create profile from taking clone from standard profile
one user can have only one profile

In Salesforce, a Profile is a fundamental security and access control component. It defines what a user can do in the Salesforce org.
1. Object Permissions
Determines what actions a user can perform on objects: Create,Read,Edit,Delete,View All,Modify All
Example: A Sales Rep may edit Opportunities but not modify Users.

2. Field-Level Security (FLS)
Specifies which fields a user can: See,Edit
Example: Salary field may be hidden for non-HR users.

3. User Permissions
Allows specific capabilities like: API Enabled,View Setup,Run Reports,Manage Dashboards

4. Tab Settings
Controls whether a tab is: Default On, Default Off,Hidden

5. Apps & Page Layout Assignments
Decides which: Apps users can access, Page layouts they see

6. Login Controls
Manages:Login IP ranges,Login hours
==========================================================================================================================================================================================
Login Access Policies video 8 - 12.25 seconds

What Are Permission Sets in Salesforce?

    created in free org - Contact Permission set, Decrpypt permission set, Delete account permission,Case permission set

    assigned permission set can be checked thourgh users, each user can have multiple permission sets

    A Permission Set is a collection of settings and permissions that give users additional access on top of their Profile.
    Think of it as:
    👉 Profile = Base access
    👉 Permission Set = Extra access
    You use Permission Sets when you want to give someone more permissions without changing their profile.
How Many Permission Sets Can a User Have?
        A user can have:
        👉 One Profile
        👉 Many Permission Sets (no strict limit)

  🏆 What Permission Sets Can Control
         ✔Object permissions,(Create, Read, Edit, Delete),✔ Field‑level security,(Make fields visible/editable),✔ App permissions
      (Access to apps, tabs, features),✔ System permissions,(API Enabled, View Setup, Modify All Data, etc.),✔ User permissions,(Manage Reports, Run Flow, etc.)
        ✔Record types,✔ Apex class access,✔ VF page access,✔ Connected apps

Permission Sets vs Permission Set Groups
    Permission Set Groups allow you to combine multiple permission sets into one bundle.
You use them when:
    You have many permission sets
    You want to assign them together efficiently
    You want to remove overlapping permissions using Muting        
==========================================================================================================================================================================================
Rename Tabs and Labels (video 9) 12.55 seconds

 What is a Permission Set Group? (video 9) 21.34 seconds

A Permission Set Group bundles multiple Permission Sets together.
   You can assign the group to a user instead of assigning multiple individual permission sets.
   It supports Muting Permissions, which allows you to remove specific permissions from the group without editing the original permission sets.

Muting Permission Set (video 9) 36.28 seconds
     A Muting Permission Set is linked to a Permission Set Group.
     It allows you to mute (disable) specific permissions from the group without changing the original permission sets.
     Muting only removes permissions that come from Permission Sets inside that specific PSG(Permission Set Group).
    It does not mute permissions coming from the Profile, other Permission Sets, or other PSGs.
    Also, muting cannot grant permissions, it will only remove them.
    Example: If a group includes “Delete” permission but you want to restrict it for certain users, you can mute “Delete” in the muting permission set.
==========================================================================================================================================================================================
Record Level Security (RLS)  (video 9) 40.02 seconds
in Salesforce controls which individual records a user can see or edit within an object. Even if a user has 
object-level permissions (like Read/Create/Edit/Delete), RLS determines access to specific records.

Sharing Settings also called OWD below is the path
setup -> Home -> Sharing Settings

 ✅ Components of Record Level Security 
        1.  Organization-Wide Defaults (OWD)
              Sets the baseline access for all users on each object (e.g., Private, Public Read Only, Public Read/Write).
              Example: If Contacts are Private, users only see records they own (or those shared with them).
        2.  Role Hierarchy
              Users higher in the hierarchy inherit access to records owned by users below them.
              Example: A Sales Manager can see records owned by their team.
        3.  Sharing Rules
              Used to open up access beyond OWD.
              Types:
                  Owner-based: Share records owned by certain roles/groups.
                  Criteria-based: Share records meeting certain field criteria.

        4.  Manual Sharing
              Record owner or admin can share a specific record with another user.
        5.  Teams
              Account Teams, Opportunity Teams, Case Teams allow sharing related records with team members.
        6.  Apex Managed Sharing


What is OWD (video 9 53.50 seconds) 
  (IMP)it is 2 steps process first we need to change owd type in Sharing Settings then remove the the view all, modify all permission in profile 
      OWD (Organization-Wide Defaults) in Salesforce is the baseline level of access that all users have to records in your organization for each object.
      It’s part of Record-Level Security and determines how restrictive or open your data is by default.

================================================================================Sandbox configureed==================================================================================================================================
Key Permissions That Cause issue, below permission should be false

      View All (object-level): Grants read access to all records of that object.
